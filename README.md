Use C#, ASP.NET, and Episerver to create a CMS for restaurant. Just for fun.

Don't forget to install Episerver Visual Studio extension

2. In the extensions window, select Online > Visual Studio Marketplace, and type "episerver" in the search box.
3. Select Episerver CMS Visual Studio Extension and click Download (or Update if already installed).
4. Restart Visual Studio.

After run the project, you will see some template/sample web features. The main function I created is in Restaurant Page. You can click on it or create more restaurant pages if you like.

You need to click the EPI button at top right corner and then go to CMS Edit to edit the contents you like.
